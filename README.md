Posters for Hackspaces

##Posters

This is a collection of posters for your hackspace.

They are split into six areas:

* General Information
* Safety
* Working Together
* "Do Something Great" and Motivation
* Respect, Clean & Tidy
* "Respect Each Other" and Conduct

##Make

To "make" the HackspacePosters.pdf from the SVG files, you must run the make.bat
file. This uses Inkscape to export to PDF files, then uses PDFtk to merge them.
